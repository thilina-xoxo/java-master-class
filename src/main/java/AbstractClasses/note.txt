entire inteface is abstract but in

example : abstract bird class that extends animal and has abstract fly method

abstracted classes can not be directly instantiated

Interface or Abstract classes

Abstract classes can have member variables
Interfaces can have static constants (public static final) -> constant values that never change
 // should be static, non static variables requires instances
 // Interfaces can not be instatiated
 // can not have constructors

 methods of interfaces are public, methods of abstract classes can have any visibility

 collection API, list interface that implement LinkedList and ArrayList
