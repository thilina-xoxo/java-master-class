Array list is generic type

List myList = new ArrayList(); <- should provide a type

correct

List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList()
// putting Integer here is sufficient in declaration

note - bounded type parameters in java generics

Abstract Class Player
<T extends Player>  // any class that extends from player or subclass of player
